Translates input file (written in English) to Tutnese.

What is Tutnese? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutnese 

Translation rules that the program accounts for: 
* Every consonant has a 3 letter translation in tutnese associated with it. (These translations can be found on the wikipedia page or in Model.cpp from lines 36-140.)
* Vowels are kept the same (a, e, i, o, u)
* Double letters are replaced by the prefix 'squa-' and the according consonant translation. (i.e. 'll' is replaced by 'squalul').
* Punctuation is kept the same.
